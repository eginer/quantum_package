Hartree-Fock
============


The Hartree-Fock module performs *Restricted* Hartree-Fock calculations (the
spatial part of the |MOs| is common for alpha and beta spinorbitals).

The Hartree-Fock program does the following:

#. Compute/Read all the one- and two-electron integrals, and store them in memory
#. Check in the |EZFIO| database if there is a set of |MOs|. If there is, it
   will read them as initial guess. Otherwise, it will create a guess.
#. Perform the |SCF| iterations

At each iteration, the |MOs| are saved in the |EZFIO| database. Hence, if the calculation
crashes for any unexpected reason, the calculation can be restarted by running again
the |SCF| with the same |EZFIO| database.

The `DIIS`_ algorithm is implemented, as well as the `level-shifting`_ method.
If the |SCF| does not converge, try again with a higher value of :option:`level_shift`.

To start a calculation from scratch, the simplest way is to remove the
``mo_basis`` directory from the |EZFIO| database, and run the |SCF| again.
