Print the ground state wave function stored in the |EZFIO| folder in the intermediate normalization. 

 It also prints a lot of information regarding the excitation operators from the reference determinant 

 and a first-order perturbative analysis of the wave function. 

 If the wave function strongly deviates from the first-order analysis, something funny is going on :)
