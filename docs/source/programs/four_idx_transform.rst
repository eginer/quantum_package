================== 
four_idx_transform 
================== 
 
 
4-index transformation of two-electron integrals from |AO| to |MO| integrals. 

 This program will compute the two-electron integrals on the |MO| basis and store it into the |EZFIO| folder. 

 This program can be useful if the AO --> MO transformation is an expensive step by itself.
