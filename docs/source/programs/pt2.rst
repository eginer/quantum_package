Second order perturbative correction to the wave function contained in the EZFIO directory. 

 This programs runs the stochastic PT2 correction on all "n_states" wave function stored in the EZFIO folder (see :option:`determinant n_states`). 

 The option for the PT2 correction are the "pt2_relative_error" which is the relative stochastic 

 error on the PT2 to reach before stopping the stochastic sampling. (see :option:`perturbation pt2_relative_error`)
