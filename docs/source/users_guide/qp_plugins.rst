    * git@gitlab.com:user/example_repository

.. option:: install <plugin_name>

    Install the plugin ``plugin_name``.

.. option:: uninstall <plugin_name>

Example
-------

Let us download, install and compile some specific external plugins from `<https://gitlab.com/eginer/qp_plugins_eginer>`_ .


First, download the git repo associated to these plugins. To do so, first go to the `plugins` directory in the |QP| and execute: 

.. code:: bash

    qp_plugins download https://gitlab.com/eginer/qp_plugins_eginer


This will create in the directory `plugins` a local copy of the git repo located at the URL you indicated. 
Then, go in `qp_plugins_eginer/stable/`

.. code:: bash

    cd qp_plugins_eginer/stable/


In the directory `stable`, there are many directories which all correspond to a specific plugin that have been developed 
by the person in charge of the git repo. All these plugins might use some global variables and routines contained 
in the core modules of the |QP|. 


Now let us install the plugin `rsdft_cipsi`: 

.. code:: bash

    qp_plugins install rsdft_cipsi

This will link this directory to the |QP| which means that when the code will be compiled, this plugin will be compiled to and therefore 
all the executables/scripts/input keywords contained in this module will be available as if there were part of the core of the |QP|. 


Then, to compile the new plugin, just recompile the |QP| as usual by going at the root of the |QP| directory: 

.. code:: bash

    cd $QP_ROOT
    ninja 

Then, if you go back to the plugin directory you just installed, you should see all the executables/scripts which have been created and 
which are now available with the `qp_run` command.
